### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Opens project using Expo.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
#and then once the packager starts up press i to open up ios simulator
```
